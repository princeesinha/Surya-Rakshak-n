# Problem Statement: Surya Rakshak - Environmental Safety Monitoring System

## The Problem

**Lack of Real-Time Environmental Awareness Puts People at Risk**

In today's world, people are increasingly exposed to harmful environmental conditions without adequate real-time monitoring or early warning systems. Key issues include:

### 1. **Invisible Environmental Threats**
- High UV radiation exposure leading to skin damage and health risks
- Dangerous temperature and humidity levels causing heat stress
- No immediate feedback when environmental conditions become hazardous

### 2. **Limited Access to Personal Environmental Data**
- Weather apps provide general area forecasts, not personal exposure levels
- No real-time monitoring of immediate surroundings
- Lack of personalized safety recommendations based on current conditions

### 3. **Poor User Experience in Safety Systems**
- Existing environmental monitoring tools are complex and technical
- No intuitive, engaging interfaces for everyday users
- Difficult to access and interpret environmental data quickly

### 4. **Disconnected Monitoring and Control**
- No integration between environmental sensing and protective measures
- Manual intervention required for safety responses
- Lack of automated alerts and recommendations

## Target Impact

**Who is affected?**
- Outdoor workers (construction, agriculture, sports)
- Health-conscious individuals
- Parents monitoring children's outdoor activities
- Anyone spending extended time outdoors

**What are the consequences?**
- Heat-related illnesses and dehydration
- UV overexposure leading to skin damage
- Reduced productivity and safety in outdoor work
- Lack of preventive health measures

## The Gap

Current solutions either provide:
- **Generic weather data** (not personalized or real-time for specific locations)
- **Complex industrial monitoring** (not accessible to everyday users)
- **Basic alerts** (without actionable recommendations or integrated controls)

**What's missing is a user-friendly, real-time environmental monitoring system that combines:**
- Personal environmental sensing
- Intuitive 3D interface design
- Immediate safety recommendations
- Integrated protective controls
- Secure, accessible user authentication

This gap leaves people vulnerable to environmental hazards that could be easily prevented with proper monitoring and timely intervention.
